# **Project Report**
## **FinSight - AI document assistant - A Role-Based Access Control System**

## **Business Problem:**

1. FinSolve Technologies faced operational inefficiencies caused by communication delays and fragmented, siloed data across departments including Finance, Marketing, HR, and Executive leadership.
2. Departmental isolation limited timely access to relevant information, slowing decision-making, strategic planning, and project execution.
3. The organization required a secure, role-based AI solution to deliver on-demand, department-specific insights while enforcing strict access controls to maintain data confidentiality and operational efficiency.

## **Project Overview**

This project implements an advanced **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** system tailored for multi-role enterprise environments. Users can upload documents (Markdown, CSV), and the system retrieves answers based on the user's role. Queries are classified and routed accordingly — SQL-type queries are translated to SQL using an LLM and executed on DuckDB, while RAG-type queries are answered via the retrieval-augmented generation pipeline, and responses are enhanced by reranking and evaluated for quality. The architecture includes:

* **Streamlit UI**: for user login, role-based access, and document upload.
* **FastAPI backend**: for business logic, user management, and RAG handling.
* **Query Classifier agent**: to route user queries to the appropriate retrieval mode.
* **SQL Agent**: processes structured data queries using an LLM for translation and DuckDB for execution.
* **RAG Agent**: retrieves and synthesizes responses from unstructured documents using embeddings and LLMs.
* **DuckDB**: for SQL-like queries over structured data (CSV).
* **Chroma vector store**: for dense embedding search (unstructured).
* **Fallback Mechanism**: to ensure graceful degradation when structured query fails.
* **Cohere Reranker**: to ensure better user trust in responses

### **Architecture Overview**

* Combines **structured data querying (SQL)** with **unstructured document retrieval (RAG)**.
* Ensures **high accuracy and flexibility** by selecting the most appropriate engine per query.
* Implements **fallback logic** for robustness — the user always gets a meaningful response.
* This system is designed to intelligently respond to user queries using either **structured SQL** or **unstructured RAG** depending on the nature of the query.

### **End-to-End Flow:**
#### 1. **User Interface Layer**
* A user enters a question through a **Streamlit UI**.
* This query is sent to the **FastAPI backend**, which handles the core logic.

#### 2. **Query Classification**
* The query first reaches a **Query Classifier Agent**, which analyzes it and decides:
  * **Is this a structured query?** (e.g., about data in a table)
  * **Or an unstructured query?** (e.g., asking for procedural guidance)

#### 3. **SQL Agent Path**
* If the classifier determines it's an **SQL-type query**:
  * The query goes to the **SQL Agent**, which uses an **LLM to convert natural language into SQL**.
  * The generated SQL is executed using **DuckDB**, a fast in-process SQL engine.
  * If the query executes successfully, the result is sent back to the user as a **SQL Response**.
    
#### 4. **Fallback Mechanism**
* If the SQL query **fails** or the response is **incomplete**, a **Fallback Trigger** is activated.
* The system automatically reroutes the query to the **RAG Agent**.

#### 5. **RAG Agent Path**

* The **RAG Agent** retrieves relevant information from documents using **Vector Search** (e.g., via ChromaDB).
* The LLM then generates a coherent answer from the retrieved chunks.
* The final **RAG-based response** is sent back to the user.


## **Key Features**

### **1. Role-Based Access Control**
* Users are assigned roles (e.g., HR, Finance, QA).
* Each document is tagged with the role it’s meant for.
* Queries are filtered to only retrieve content associated with the user's role.

### **2. Dual Query Handling (RAG + SQL)**
* **Unstructured queries** (e.g., "What are the QA best practices?") → handled by Chroma vector search + LLM.
* **Structured queries** (e.g., "Show me all employees with salary > 100K") → handled via DuckDB.
  
| Mode    | Triggered When              | Engine            |
| ------- | --------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **RAG** | General, text-based queries | Chroma DB + LLM   |
| **SQL** | Structured/tabular queries  | DuckDB SQL engine |


## **3. Why DuckDB for Structured Queries?**
Adopted **DuckDB** for handling structured queries on uploaded CSVs because:

* **In-process SQL engine**: DuckDB runs embedded in Python, no separate server needed.
* **Zero setup**: No configuration required; great for file-based structured queries.
* **Lightweight + Fast**: Efficiently handles large CSV files in memory.
* **Supports Pandas + SQL natively**: Easy to switch between Python dataframes and SQL.
* **Isolated query execution**: Each user session can be sandboxed.

This made DuckDB a perfect fit for answering precise, structured queries over tabular data uploaded by the user.


## **4. Query Classification Module**
A **query classifier** was implemented to determine the intent behind the user's input:

| Intent | Target System | Example Query                     |
| ------ | ------------- | --------------------------------- |
| RAG    | Chroma + LLM  | “Summarize this finance document” |
| SQL    | DuckDB        | “List employees earning over $50k”|

* The classifier directs the query to either:
  * RAG (textual search in vector DB),
  * SQL (execute structured query using DuckDB).
This significantly **improved accuracy and speed**, avoiding LLM overhead when a SQL answer sufficed.

## **5. Fallback Handling Strategy**
In edge cases, a **fallback mechanism** is implemented:
1. If a **SQL query fails** (e.g., malformed, missing table):
   * Log the error,
   * Fallback to the RAG system with rephrased prompt like:
     *"Unable to process SQL. Try answering from available documents instead."*

2. If **no relevant docs** found in RAG:
   * Return a graceful message,
   * Suggest rephrasing or uploading new content.
This ensures the system is **resilient** and never leaves the user with a hard error.

## **6. Reranking with Cohere**
To improve relevance of retrieved documents, added a **Cohere Reranker** in the RAG flow:
* After Chroma vector search retrieves top-k chunks,
* Reranker scores them based on their semantic match with the query,
* Only top-N reranked chunks are passed to the LLM

## **7. Evaluation Framework for RAG (LLM-RAG Eval)**
An **automated evaluation pipeline** to assess output quality. It generates question-answer (QA) pairs from existing documents and evaluates how well the RAG model performs on these questions by comparing the predicted answers against reference answers using LLM-based evaluation.

### Metrics:
* **Faithfulness**: Is the response grounded in retrieved content?
* **Relevance**: Is the answer contextually appropriate?
* **Conciseness**: Is it direct and non-redundant?

### How it works:
* Collect query-response pairs during usage
* Run them through an **OpenAI or LLM-based evaluator**
* Store per-metric scores in CSV for further analytics
* Used to compare performance with/without reranker and classifier


## **8. Automation Testing**
### **Backend API Testing – Pytest**
* FastAPI endpoints (`/chat`, `/upload`, `/login`, etc.) tested using `TestClient`
* Verified classifier routing, SQL execution, RAG fallback logic

### **Frontend Testing – Playwright**
* End-to-end tests for **Streamlit UI**:
  * Login flow
  * Role-based tab rendering
  * Document upload
  * Query submission and output display

* **Video recording** enabled for demo and review

## **Tech Stack**
 * AI/LLM: OpenAI GPT-4o, LangChain
 * Backend: FastAPI, SQLite, DuckDB
 * Frontend: Streamlit
 * Vector DB: Chroma DB
 * File Support: Markdown, CSV
 * Access Control: RBAC
 * Testing: Pytest, Playwright

## **Future Enhancements**
* Support **admin analytics dashboard** (e.g., query types, usage).
* Add **table+text hybrid retrieval** (RAG with tabular fusion).
* Caching of SQL queries for repeated execution.

## **Conclusion**
This project delivers a **production-ready RAG system** with:
* Role-based access,
* Dual-mode intelligent query routing,
* Reranking for precision,
* Automated evaluation and testing at every layer.

This RAG system demonstrates a **flexible, intelligent retrieval pipeline** that dynamically routes user queries to either unstructured (LLM-based) or structured (SQL-based) engines. The use of **DuckDB**, **query classification**, and **fallback design** has led to a robust solution that balances performance, explainability, and adaptability. With strong modularity and extensibility it’s an ideal architecture for real-world enterprise AI assistants where both document knowledge and structured analytics are needed in one place
